System Syzygy is a story and a puzzle game, in the style of Cliff Johnson's
_The Fool's Errand_ and _3 in Three_, and of Andrew Plotkin's _System's
Twilight_.  As you move through the game, solving a variety of different kinds
of puzzles, the game tells the story a piece at a time.  By the end of the
game, all the different puzzles and pieces of the story come together into a
single meta-puzzle.
