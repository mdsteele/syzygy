# System Syzygy

*System Syzygy* is a puzzle game, in the style of Cliff Johnson's
[*The Fool's Errand*](http://fools-errand.com/) and
[*3 in Three*](http://www.fools-errand.com/04-3T/index.htm), and of Andrew
Plotkin's [*System's Twilight*](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/twilight.html).  It
is still a work in progress.
