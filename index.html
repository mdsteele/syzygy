        A motley crew (of autonomous programs), a peaceful (if perhaps
        mysterious) mission, and no enemy vessels for lightyears
        around&mdash;what could possibly go wrong?  Just about everything, as
        it turns out.  And after a strange midflight disaster knocks out most
        of the ship's subsystems (sabotage, perhaps?), you'll have to guide
        Mezure&mdash;the plucky new administrator process&mdash;and the rest of
        the crew to repair the damage.  But beware&mdash;not all is as it seems
        aboard the <i>H.L.S. System</i>.

        <i>System Syzygy</i> is a story and a puzzle game, in the style of
        Cliff Johnson's classic Macintosh
        games <a href="http://www.fools-errand.com/02-FE/index.htm">
          <i>The Fool's Errand</i></a> and
        <a href="http://www.fools-errand.com/04-3T/index.htm">
          <i>3 in Three</i></a>, and of Andrew Plotkin's
        <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/twilight/index.html">
          <i>System's Twilight</i></a>.  As you move through the game, solving
        a variety of different kinds of puzzles, the game tells the story a
        piece at a time.  By the end of the game, all the different puzzles and
        pieces of the story come together into a single meta-puzzle.

        Summer 2018.
